# FourierSimJS
A simple and non-efficient fourier simulation
## Known Bugs
(None at the moment)
## Features
- Vector size
- Vector speed/frequency
- Vector offset
## Recent Features
- Variable FPS (With delta time)
## Upcoming Features
- Reverse fourier (you draw something and the website generates vectors for you).
- Custom colors
- (I am open for suggestions)
## Inspiration
