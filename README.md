# FourierSimJS
A simple and non-efficient fourier simulation
## Currently working on
- Fade factor bug
## Known Bugs
- With low FPS the fade factor has less effect due to fade implementation
## Features
- Vector size
- Vector speed/frequency
- Vector offset
## Recent Features
- Variable FPS (With delta time)
- Custom colors
## Upcoming Features
- Discrete fourier (you draw something and the website generates vectors for you)
- (I am open for suggestions)
## Inspiration
