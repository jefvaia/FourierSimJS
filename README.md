# FourierSimJS
A simple and non-efficient fourier simulation
## Features
- Vector size
- Vector speed/frequency
- Vector offset
## Recent Features
- Variable FPS (With delta time)
## Upcoming Features
- Reverse fourier (you draw something and the website generates vectors for you).
- Custom colors
- (I am open for suggestions)

### For any testers
Please do not fiddle around with the vector input and expect anything to happen when you skip vectors. You are supposed to increase the vector count 1 by 1.
