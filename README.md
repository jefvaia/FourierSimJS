# FourierSimJS
A simple and non-efficient fourier simulation
## Currently working on
- Lag related problems
## Known Bugs
- Lag makes the line jump
## Features
- Vector size
- Vector speed/frequency
- Vector offset
## Recent Features
- Variable FPS (With delta time)
- Custom colors
- Working fade effect
## Upcoming Features
- Discrete fourier (you draw something and the website generates vectors for you)
- (I am open for suggestions)
## Inspiration
